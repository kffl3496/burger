# burger

Created a logger webpage that utilizes node, express, handlebars, and mysql.  The page allows the user to submit a type of burger that is then displayed on the page.  The user can then enter as many types of burgers as they wish then have the option to "devour" said burgers individually.  A fun project to learn many different factors in web-development. The page utilizes handlebars html to display the front-end and incorporates express routes, node, and mysql to source the database information from the users input into the page.
